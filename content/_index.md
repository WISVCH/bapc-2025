Welcome to the website of BAPC 2025!

The Benelux Algorithm Programming Contest (BAPC) is a contest for students of the Benelux universities. Students are served a
series of algorithmic problems to solve. The goal of each team is to solve as many problems as possible within the five hour time limit.
Potential solutions are submitted and corrected by an automated judging system. The best teams for each university will
participate in the [NWERC 2025](https://2025.nwerc.eu/).

The 2025 edition of the BAPC will be held on the 25th of October, 2025.
The contest will be held on the campus of the Delft University of Technology.
