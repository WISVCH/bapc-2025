Dear contestants, coaches and programming enthusiasts,

A warm welcome to BAPC 2025! We are delighted to have you join us and look forward to sharing this exciting day with you. This year, BAPC is hosted in Delft at the Delft University of Technology. We wish you an amazing time and hope you will also take a moment to discover a bit more of what Delft has to offer.

On this page, you will find information about Delft, the contest venue, jury, systems and schedule, along with, of course, the main event: our amazing programming contest.

The CHipCie, a committee consisting of 16 dedicated (former) students from the study association Christiaan Huygens, has worked very hard to make this day possible! From technical setup to logistics, every member gave their best to make this contest run as smoothly as possible.

A special thank-you goes to the jury, who have carefully crafted a set of challenging and creative problems meant to bring out the best in all contestants. Their contribution cannot be overstated.

We hope that you will have an amazing time! Best of luck to all contestants and above all, have fun!

On behalf of the CHipCie,<br>
Eduard Cimpean<br>
Contest Director BAPC 2025

## Welcome
Welcome to the city of technical expertise in the Netherlands: Delft!
Here, many technical institutions have settled themselves such as TNO, Deltares and QuTech, among many others.
Delft is a true student city with student life blooming in all corners of the city.
The city of Delft also holds a rich history and dates back from as early as 1246!

### Population
The university has some effects on the population in Delft.
Did you know that the ratio of male residents between 20 and 30 year old in Delft is about twice as high as the national average?
And for the age range 20–24 this is even as high as three times the national average!

### Associations
Student life is very rich in Delft.
Many students are part of a student association: social, sports, games, hobby associations.
There is certainly an association for every occasion!
All associations hold in common a social aspect of hosting fun events and bringing students closer together.
Even BAPC 2025 is organised by members of the study association W.I.S.V. 'Christiaan Huygens'!
