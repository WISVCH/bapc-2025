The Benelux Algorithm Programming Contest (BAPC) is a contest in which teams from leading universities in Belgium, the
Netherlands, and Luxembourg are served a series of algorithmic problems/puzzles. The goal of each team is to solve the
most puzzles as possible within the set time limit. Solutions need to be programmed out on a computer and can be
submitted to an automated judging system, after which the solution is checked.

The teams that have solved the most puzzles at the end of the contest qualify for the [Northwestern European Regional
Contest](https://2025.nwerc.eu). In this regional competition, the teams can qualify themselves for a ticket to the [International Collegiate
Programming Contest](https://icpc.global) (also known as the World Finals) or the [Europe Championship](https://euc.icpc.global).

The BAPC 2025 is hosted by the Delft University of Technology, and organized by W.I.S.V. \`Christiaan Huygens'.
