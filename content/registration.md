Registration will open on the 20th of September and will close on **Friday the 3rd of October**.
Registration will be done through the [ICPC system](https://icpc.global/regionals/finder/BAPC-2026).
Teams can be promoted from the preliminaries.
Teams will be accepted once the registration is closed, on Saturday the 4th of October.
Please don't register more than five teams per institution.

## Team Admission rules

The following rules will be adhered to when accepting teams. Please note that based on previous years, we expect that
at least three teams per institution should be no problem.

* The maximum number of teams (50) will not be exceeded.
* Every institution will be guaranteed one team.
* `n`th teams will be accepted based on preliminary results.
    - The `n`th teams will be awarded round-robin per institution
    - Teams will be prioritized on the problems solved and time penalty on the preliminary.
    - Institutions without a preliminary will be awarded extra slots last. The coach may in this case provide an order for the teams to be accepted in.
    - No institution gets a `n+1` team slot until all registrations of `n`th team of an institution is accepted.
    - In case of a tie, either both teams get a slot or neither team gets a slot.
* No more than five teams per institution will be accepted.

Teams should conform to the [team composition rules](/rules/#team-composition). 
All profiles of all team members should be completed by Friday the 3rd of October in the ICPC system.
Teams with incomplete registrations will not be accepted.
